            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in this reÅ¿pect alÅ¿o (among others (it is, that he is called the <hi>Mediatour of the Covenant,</hi> (in thoÅ¿e places forenamed,) the new Covenant. Even as <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> was the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> (for to him the ApoÅ¿tle there alludes) the <hi>PubliÅ¿her</hi> of it. So was ChriÅ¿t of the new Covenant; Gods <hi>MeÅ¿Å¿enger</hi> and <hi>AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador</hi> Å¿ent and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to declare the Gracious purpoÅ¿e of God towards his Elect, held forth in that Covenant. Here is now the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Å¿taff of this Ladder; the Å¿econd Å¿tep in this great work of ChriÅ¿ts <hi>MediatorÅ¿hip.</hi> He is a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Men, <hi>viz.</hi> as an <hi>Interpreter</hi> an <hi>IntermeÅ¿Å¿enger</hi> betwixt them, Imparting the mind of God to Man.</p>
                  <p>And in this way doth he promote this great deÅ¿ign<note place="margin">Thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting that great deÅ¿igne.</note> of <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> the Reconciling of <hi>men to God:</hi> viz. by <hi>enlightning</hi> of them.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:124278:36"/> all that are Å¿o enlightned. And by this means he beginneth to diÅ¿Å¿olve the work of the Divell.

This is Satans grand deÅ¿igne, as the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿ets it forth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>In whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes of them which beleeve not, leaÅ¿t the light of the glorious GoÅ¿pel of ChriÅ¿t who is the Image of God, Å¿hould Å¿hine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.]</hi> And by this means he maintaineth, confirmeth, increaÅ¿eth that alienation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trangement betwixt God and Man, which was at the firÅ¿t by himÅ¿elfe introduced. This is the great barr which hinders all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and the Å¿oul, <hi>Ignorance.</hi> The ApoÅ¿tle Å¿peaking of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 4.18. he Å¿aith <hi>[They were alienated</hi> (eÅ¿tranged) <hi>from the life of God]</hi> But how came they Å¿o to be? The ReaÅ¿on followeth <hi>[Through the Ignorance that was in them, becauÅ¿e of the blindneÅ¿Å¿e of their mindes.]</hi> Thus are men eÅ¿tranged from God. Now for the effecting of a Reconciliation, ChriÅ¿t's firÅ¿t work is to diÅ¿pell this <hi>darkneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> to open theÅ¿e <hi>blind eyes,</hi> and to make known unto men the things which belong unto their peace: which he doth by the <hi>revelation</hi> of his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> making known the good will of God unto them; cauÅ¿ing that <hi>Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Å¿alvation to appear unto them;</hi> To Å¿hine not

                  </p>
                  <p>Even as at the firÅ¿t, being a <hi>Mediator</hi> in the work of <hi>Creation</hi> (for Å¿o he was, <hi>[By him God made the worlds,</hi> Heb. 1.2.) he laid the foundation of that work in <hi>light,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firÅ¿t Creature that was produced, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3.

This is to him no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: So as Å¿till he pardoneth us freely.

Å¿uch works as his Father had given him to do, <hi>John</hi> 5.36. And Å¿uch

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:124278:122"/> Å¿ame, not Å¿ubject to change, or alter, <hi>I the Lord change not, Mal.</hi> 3.6. If there be a change, it begins on man's part. Had not <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> been changed towards their God; had not they broke the <hi>Covenant</hi> which he had made with their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would have been the Å¿ame to them that he was to him: he would have dealt as friendly, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with them, as he did with him: So as there Å¿hould not have needed to have been a Mediatour betwixt him and them, more then there was betwixt him and their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. That God was changed in this his carriage towards them, they might thank themÅ¿elves; the breach began on their parts. So is it here; Had not <hi>man</hi> firÅ¿t turned ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>God,</hi> broke covenant with him, God would never have turned enemy to man; there Å¿hould never have been any need of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt them, no more then there was betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and him in Å¿tate of innocency. Herein then let us juÅ¿tifie God; charging the ground of this enmity upon our Å¿elves. We are enemies to him, otherwiÅ¿e he had never been at enmity to us.</p>
                  <p>That we are Å¿o, we Å¿hall need no other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but what we carry about with us.

Here then we have another touch-Å¿tone, whereby we may diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a great deal of falÅ¿e and counterfeit mortification in the world. Many have <hi>left</hi> their Å¿ins, who have not <hi>mortified</hi> them: No, if their Å¿ins be dead, they died a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death,</hi> they died alone. As for them, they were Å¿o far from offering <hi>violence</hi> to their luÅ¿ts, from putting them to death, that they would willingly have Å¿aved their lives, if it had lyen in their power. And being dead, they follow them to their graves, as they do their <hi>dear friends,</hi> mourning and lamenting over them that they muÅ¿t part. Thus doth the <hi>aged Adulterer</hi> part with his inordinate luÅ¿t;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.19.</note> being now gray-headed, and his <hi>body dead,</hi> (as it is Å¿aid of <hi>Abraham's,</hi>) he leaveth the tricks of his youth, (as he counts and calls them.) But no thanks to him: they have left him. His Å¿in dieth according to the courÅ¿e of nature, dieth for age. And thus a man that was <hi>intemperate in his youth,</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:124278:206"/> (which yet is not ordinary,) Å¿ometimes he becometh Å¿ober, and abÅ¿temious in his age. But what is the cauÅ¿e of it? why the reaÅ¿on inducing him to it is no other, then that which old <hi>Barzillai</hi> gave unto <hi>David,</hi> why he was not willing to follow the Court, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.34. He was now <hi>grown old,</hi> Å¿o as he could not <hi>diÅ¿cern betwixt good and evill,</hi> he had <hi>no taÅ¿te in that he eat, or in that he drunk.</hi> Upon the like ground the aged Å¿inner lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his <hi>intemperance;</hi> Time having Å¿nowed upon his head, and plowed upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, he cannot now find that Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e, that delight in his Å¿in, which formerly he did.
