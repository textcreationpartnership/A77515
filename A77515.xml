         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In this reſpect it is that he is called <hi>the Angell</hi> (or <hi>Meſſenger) of the Covenant, Malachy</hi> 3.1. It is ſpoken of Chriſt, who was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of the Goſpel Covenant, the Covenant of Grace. And in this reſpect alſo (among others (it is, that he is called the <hi>Mediatour of the Covenant,</hi> (in thoſe places forenamed,) the new Covenant. Even as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> (for to him the Apoſtle there alludes) the <hi>Publiſher</hi> of it. So was Chriſt of the new Covenant; Gods <hi>Meſſenger</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> ſent and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him to declare the Gracious purpoſe of God towards his Elect, held forth in that Covenant. Here is now the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſtaff of this Ladder; the ſecond ſtep in this great work of Chriſts <hi>Mediatorſhip.</hi> He is a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Men, <hi>viz.</hi> as an <hi>Interpreter</hi> an <hi>Intermeſſenger</hi> betwixt them, Imparting the mind of God to Man.</p>
                  <p>And in this way doth he promote this great deſign<note place="margin">Thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting that great deſigne.</note> of <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> the Reconciling of <hi>men to God:</hi> viz. by <hi>enlightning</hi> of them. This is his work. [<hi>He is that true light, which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world:</hi> John 1.9.] Enlightneth them with a <hi>Common, Naturall</hi> light of Reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; So he enlightneth all Men.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:124278:36"/> all that are ſo enlightned. And by this means he beginneth to diſſolve the work of the Divell. It was the way whereby Satan firſt eſtranged man from God, by <hi>blinding his eyes.</hi> And by the ſame means it is that he holdeth him under that eſtrangement, by continuing him under that blindneſſe. This is Satans grand deſigne, as the Apoſtle ſets it forth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>In whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes of them which beleeve not, leaſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.]</hi> And by this means he maintaineth, confirmeth, increaſeth that alienation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangement betwixt God and Man, which was at the firſt by himſelfe introduced. This is the great barr which hinders all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and the ſoul, <hi>Ignorance.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. he ſaith <hi>[They were alienated</hi> (eſtranged) <hi>from the life of God]</hi> But how came they ſo to be? The Reaſon followeth <hi>[Through the Ignorance that was in them, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their mindes.]</hi> Thus are men eſtranged from God. Now for the effecting of a Reconciliation, Chriſt's firſt work is to diſpell this <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> to open theſe <hi>blind eyes,</hi> and to make known unto men the things which belong unto their peace: which he doth by the <hi>revelation</hi> of his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> making known the good will of God unto them; cauſing that <hi>Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation to appear unto them;</hi> To ſhine not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:124278:36"/> onely upon their <hi>Heads,</hi> but into their <hi>Hearts,</hi> (as the Apoſtles ſay of themſelves 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts,]</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them an effectuall knowledge of God, and his will, whereby they are brought in to comply with God, and to cloſe with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own termes, the terms of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> Thus in this way is Chriſt a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even as at the firſt, being a <hi>Mediator</hi> in the work of <hi>Creation</hi> (for ſo he was, <hi>[By him God made the worlds,</hi> Heb. 1.2.) he laid the foundation of that work in <hi>light,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Creature that was produced, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. Even ſo in this <hi>new Creation,</hi> in effecting this great worke of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the foundation of it in <hi>light,</hi> even the light of ſupernaturall knowledge, the knowledge of God and his will; By that means making way for peace. But to paſſe on.</p>
                  <p>Having done with the two firſt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſteps of this ladder, come we now to the two next; both which belong to the <hi>Prieſtly</hi> office of Chriſt, as the two former did to his <hi>Propheticall.</hi> This our <hi>Mediator,</hi> as he was an <hi>Arbitrator</hi> betwixt God and Man, and an <hi>Interpreter</hi> or <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> making knowne the mind of God unto Man; ſo ſhall we alſo find him an <hi>Advocate</hi> and a <hi>Surety.</hi> Here are the two next and principall ſtaves of this ladder, the chief and principall parts of Chriſts Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip.

They could not in and by themſelves, as ſeparated from their ſpirituall ſignifications, ſanctifie or purifie the <hi>Conſcience;</hi> they being <hi>Corporall,</hi> and that <hi>Spirituall.</hi> Neither could they give an abſolution <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> they could not give any aſſurance to the <hi>Conſcience</hi> that ſin was pardoned, and reconciliation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with God. In reference hereunto the Apoſtle telleth us <hi>ver.</hi> 4. of that 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter, that <hi>It is not poſsible that the blood of Buls and of Goats ſhould take away ſin:</hi> Take away the <hi>Eternall</hi> guilt of it. And as for the <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Temporall,</hi> it extended (as I ſaid) only to ſome kindes of ſin. Thence was it (as the Hebrew Doctours obſerve) that <hi>David</hi> deprecating of his <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murther, Pſal.</hi> 51.16. he waves the offering of Sacrifice for them. Why
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:124278:61"/> ſo? not onely becauſe Sacrifices themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Blood of Chriſt, could not ought availe to the purging away of any ſin; but alſo becauſe the Law had provided no ſacrifices for thoſe ſins. To which the Apoſtle may be conceived to allude <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. where ſpeaking of that unpardonable ſin, <hi>the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> wilfull malice againſt the Truth of the Goſpel received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; he ſaith, <hi>There remaineth no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for that ſin.</hi> But now the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as it is a true and reall <hi>Expiation,</hi> making ſatisfaction for ſin, and ſo purging the conſcience from the <hi>guilt</hi> of it, ſo it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>all ſin.</hi> So it doth, where the <hi>remedy</hi> is not <hi>refuſed,</hi> as it is in the ſin fore-named, that ſin exempted from mercy.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I at the length, taking hold of the clew of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> held forth in the ſacred Scriptures, paſſed through this laſt <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or <hi>proof;</hi> upon which I have inſiſted the longer, becauſe I apprehend it to be of ſpeciall conſequence and importance for the vindicating and clearing of this Truth, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt's taking away of ſin</hi> by way of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,</hi> by making <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> unto the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for it.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that the Adverſary yet ſeeketh out for other evaſions beſides thoſe already named, for the declining of the force of this Argument.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this it is anſwered, 1. that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables</hi> are no convincing <hi>Arguments.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place) they muſt not be ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched beyond the ſtaple, beyond that point to which they are directed, and at which they aim: In ſo doing men may make (and ſome have made) ſtrange worke with <hi>Parables.</hi> In that of <hi>Luke</hi> 12.39, 40. our <hi>Saviour</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth himſelf to a <hi>Theife:</hi> And <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. he propounds the pattern of the <hi>unjuſt Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> for our Imitation.

True, <hi>God</hi> is that <hi>King</hi> and he for giveth our <hi>ſins</hi> as that King did his
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:124278:74"/> ſervants <hi>debt,</hi> freely without any ſatisfaction on our part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Why, but that King recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no ſatisfaction at all, neither from the ſervant himſelfe, nor from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here the parable is ſtretched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſtaple, urged beyond the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it: which is only to ſhew, that as that <hi>King</hi> diſcharged his ſervant without any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from him, he not being <hi>par ſolvendo,</hi> not able to make any ſatisfaction; even ſo doth God deal with his ſervants, freely forgiving their ſins, without any ſatisfaction from them, which they are never able to make. This is all that can be extorted from that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> But yet they reply. <hi>God</hi> ſo forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us,<note place="margin">God forgiveth ſin without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</note> as he would have us to forgive others. That is the main ſcope of the Parable; as we may learn from the laſt verſe of that chapter. And thus the Apoſtle alſo preſſeth it, that herein Chriſtians ſhould make God their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; <hi>[Forgiving one another even as God hath forgiven you,</hi> Eph. 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> Now this we are to do <hi>freely.</hi> Thus are we to <hi>give</hi> freely, <hi>hoping for nothing again,</hi> Luke 6.35.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And thus doth God forgive us, without any <hi>Recompence,</hi> whether from us, or any other. As for the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, God is no gainer by it: only the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:124278:74"/> Law is thereby ſatisfied. Even as it is with one who freely (as a Chriſtian) forgiveth another ſome capitall offence commited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne perſon, yet leaveth him to give ſatisfaction to the Law, which it is not in his power to abſolve and free him from: He is no gainer by that ſatisfaction; no more is God by that ſatisfaction which is made by Chriſt. This is to him no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: So as ſtill he pardoneth us freely. And thus you ſee how this Doctrine of Chriſt's ſatisfaction it conſiſts well enough with the Grace of God, his <hi>Grace towards us.</hi>

                  <p>

That God ſhould thus deal with his Son, his <hi>dear</hi> Son, his <hi>Onely</hi> Son, his <hi>Innocent</hi> Son, thus to deliver him up to the death, as a Surety for our ſakes: Here the Adverſary with open mouth exclaims againſt this our doctrine, as charging God with the greateſt <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> that ever was heard of.</p>

It was not without cauſe, and great cauſe, that God thus delivered his Son to the death.

Thus did the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> being incloſed in the <hi>Grave,</hi> he carried away the <hi>gates of death,</hi> which would have cruſhed all the ſons of Men into the pit of Hell.

                  <p>Neither is this to be attributed to any <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Power</hi> in him, but to the <hi>perfection of his nature.</hi> Upon this account it is that wee ſay, that <hi>God cannot</hi> do this or that, which <hi>man can</hi> do.

Not a <hi>Legall,</hi> but an <hi>Evangelicall</hi> keeping, when the promiſes of grace being beleeved, there is a ſerious deſire and indeavour of yeilding obedience to all God's Commandements.

                  <p>And as he beginneth this worke in them,<note place="margin">With perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> ſo he maintaineth and continues it.

The like he doth for all that are given to him, taking order for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in faith: So as though it may fail in the <hi>mouth</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> did,) yet it ſhall never fail in the <hi>Heart.</hi> And as in faith, ſo in <hi>Holineſſe;</hi> this he alſo maintaines; which he doth by the continuall <hi>Supply of his Spirit,</hi> mortifying and keeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der corruption; nouriſhing and exciting of grace: putting them on in the courſe of their Obedience; <hi>guiding their feet into the waies of peace</hi> (Luk. 1.79.) Cauſing them to walk <hi>in the ſtatutes,</hi> and to <hi>keep the Judgments</hi> of their God: and ſo to yeild an <hi>Evangelicall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to his Law; <hi>keeping his word,</hi> and his <hi>Covenant:</hi> walking in their meaſure <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Lord unto all pleaſing:</hi> Not willingly offending or provoking him. Thus doth this our Mediatour ſave his people <hi>from their ſins</hi> (as the Angel telleth <hi>Joſeph) Matthew</hi> 1.21. Thoſe who beleeve on him, they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:124278:82"/> are his <hi>people:</hi> And them hee ſaveth from their ſins, not onely from the <hi>Guilt,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>Power</hi> of them. <hi>He ſaveth them from all their uncleanneſſes,</hi> (as the Prophet hath it <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29.) So as whileſt ſin is not <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to them, it doth not reigne in them. No, thus they ſin not. So ſaith Saint <hi>John</hi> of <hi>him</hi> that abideth in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>[He ſinneth not.]</hi> Not willingly, with full conſent of will: not ſo as to make a practiſe of ſin, ſo as to live in a courſe of known ſin.

Preſumptuous ſinners are ſtrangers unto Chriſt; they never had any lively apprehenſion, any effectuall knowledge of him. Thoſe who ſo know him, he keepeth them from ſuch ſins, whereby they ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and make void the Covenant betwixt their God and them.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee the former Branch of this Point opened, and explained. How Chriſt is a <hi>Surety on the believers part to God.</hi> A Surety in way of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> for what is paſt: A Surety in way of <hi>Caution,</hi> for what is to come.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the later, to ſee how he is a Surety on <hi>God's part to man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">II.

Now to theſe the Apoſtle joyns alſo the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as giving yet a further Teſtimony. It is the Spirit that beareth witneſſe [ſaith the ſixth verſe there.) Not but that the Blood and the water bear witneſſe alſo. The <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt ſhed upon the Croſſe, and ſprinkled upon the Conſcience of the Beleever, that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up the Covenant to him. And ſo doth the work of Grace, the work of <hi>Sanctification</hi> wrought in the heart by the Spirit. But beſides
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:124278:86"/> this, there is yet another witneſs, which is the <hi>witneſſe of the ſpirit: viz.</hi> an Immediate work of the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt, ſealing up the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace unto the ſoul and conſcience of a beleever; aſſuring and perſwading him of Gods performance of the conditions of his part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The witneſs of the Spirit, what?</note>This is the <hi>witneſſe</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpea- of in that known place <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits that we are the children of God.]</hi> The ſpirit beareth witneſſe concerning our <hi>Adoption, with</hi> our Spirit, or to our Spirit (the Original wil bear either, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

And this it doth, not only <hi>mediately,</hi> by the work of it; by making a real and permanent impreſſion upon the ſoul, ſtamping the <hi>Image of God</hi> upon it, making it <hi>partaker of the Divine nature,</hi> (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the <hi>work of Grace,</hi> which conſiſteth in thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Qualities of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2.

Not only ſo but beſides this there is a more immediate <hi>witneſſe of the Spirit,</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up that and other benefits unto the ſoul.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:124278:86"/> other. <hi>His Spirit</hi> beareth witneſſe with the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt viz.</hi> by obſerving the work of that ſpirit, the work of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> wrought in &amp; upon the ſoul.

Thus doth the Spirit notifie unto the ſoul of a Beleever it own intereſt in Chriſt and his Benefits.

I ſhall take notice only of four of them, which I ſhall preſent unto you in ſuch obvious terms, as you may more eaſily remember, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:124278:90"/> carry away. Chriſt appeareth in the preſence of God, interceding for his Elect, 1. As an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> 2. As an <hi>Advocate.</hi> 3. As an <hi>Atturney.</hi> 4. As a <hi>Solicitour.</hi> Every of theſe is a kind of <hi>Interceſſour,</hi> appearing for, and negotiating on the behalfe of others, for their good and benefit. And every of theſe wayes may Chriſt be ſaid to be an <hi>Interceſſour,</hi> appearing before God for us. Paſſe them over ſeverally, briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As an <hi>Agent.</hi> A <hi>Lidger Ambaſſadour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1.

Thus may <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be ſaid to <hi>appear in the preſence of God for us; viz.</hi> as an <hi>Agent,</hi> an <hi>Ambaſſadour, Legatus foederis,</hi> (as <hi>Malachy</hi> cals him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.) the <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſadour of the Covenant.</hi> So he was upon <hi>Earth:</hi> Then he was an <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> an <hi>Agent</hi> on <hi>God's part,</hi> to declare and confirm the Covenant unto us.

                  </p>
                  <p>So I may not unfitly, not improperly call him, in regard of his <hi>conſtant reſidence</hi> there. That is the difference (as you know) betwixt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:124278:90"/> a <hi>Lidger,</hi> and an <hi>Extraordinary Ambaſſadour:</hi> The one is ſent upon ſome particular emergent occaſion; the other maketh his abode in a place.

Till then he ſhall appear in the preſence of God; <hi>ever living, to make interceſſion for thoſe that come unto God by him,</hi> (as the Apoſtle hath it) <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                  <p>And great need there is that he ſhould do ſo; that he ſhould be a <hi>Lidger</hi> in Heaven,<note place="margin">Great need that Chriſt ſhould be a Lidger in Heaven.</note> that he ſhould continually appear in the preſence of God interceding <hi>for</hi> his people, in as much as there is one continually interceding <hi>againſt</hi> them, even that <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren</hi> (of whom I made mention even now) who <hi>accuſeth them before God night and day.

                  <p>Such is Chriſt's <hi>Agency</hi> in Heaven, a <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Interceſſion;</hi> which, ſhould it ceaſe but for a moment,<note place="margin">Millenaries confuted.</note> what ſhould become of all his people here upon Earth?

Thoſe whom God hath before time given unto Chriſt out of the world, he in time gathereth them out of the world.

Thus doth Chriſt gather the Subjects of his Kingdome here.</p>
                  <p>This was his work when he was upon <hi>Earth. [O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathered thy children!]</hi> It was the paſſionate expoſtulation of our bleſſed Saviour with, and lamentation over that City, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. This he then aſſayed to do by thoſe externall diſpenſations; coming himſelfe, and ſending his meſſengers to that people; inviting, commanding, promiſing, threatning. And the like he ſtill doth, being
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:124278:101"/> himſelfe in <hi>Heaven,</hi> he ſetteth up his <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi> So runs that propheticall promiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.22. <hi>Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up my Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard to the people.]</hi> Thus do <hi>Princes</hi> gather their people to themſelves, by ſetting up their <hi>Standards.</hi> And thus doth the Lord Jeſus ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Subjects together, by ſetting up his <hi>Standard,</hi> viz. the Miniſtry of the word, the preaching of the Goſpel, which holdeth forth <hi>Chriſt crucified, (Gal.</hi> 3.1.) as the Royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard doth the Armes of the Prince. This is the outward means which Chriſt maketh uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Which being accompanied with the ſecret concurrence of his Spirit, it is now made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall unto that bleſſed end; It now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a powerfull attractive to draw men unto Chriſt. <hi>[Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, Pſal.</hi> 110.3. When Chriſt goeth forth accompanying his word with his Spirit, this is the day of his power, and now his people come, and come willingly unto him. This is that which Chriſt foretold that he would do, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. <hi>If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.]</hi> And this he doth, being lifted up, firſt upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> then upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men; all belonging to the Election of grace, whether <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> bringing them home to himſelfe, to receive and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him as their <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> to believe on him, to be governed by him;

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:124278:121"/> man be, he will never look out after a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, a Peace-maker. Had not <hi>Abſalom</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the deep diſpleaſure of his Father againſt him, in baniſhing him from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he would never have made means to <hi>Joab</hi> to be a Mediatour for him, as he did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.29.

Till a poor ſinner come to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God as an Enemy, as an offended and incenſed God, ready to take vengeance upon him: till he come to ſee himſelfe in <hi>Abſalom's</hi> caſe, an out-caſt, rejected, ſeparated from the preſence of his God and Father, from the preſence of his grace here, and (without time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciliation) of his glory hereafter, in the caſe of thoſe <hi>Tyrians</hi> and <hi>Sydonians,</hi> in an undone condition; he will never ſeek out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he may have any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by his Mediation. Let this then be the firſt work: As many of us as have not hitherto been throughly convinced hereof, labour now to be. Behold God an Enemy to us: but withall take notice of the firſt <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> of this enmity, where it firſt brake in, on which part it began. Not on God's part no; <hi>God is one</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in that fore-named Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20.) One, as in <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſo in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: ſibi conſtans, ſemper idem.</hi> Alwayes the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:124278:122"/> ſame, not ſubject to change, or alter, <hi>I the Lord change not, Mal.</hi> 3.6. If there be a change, it begins on man's part. Had not <hi>Iſrael</hi> been changed towards their God; had not they broke the <hi>Covenant</hi> which he had made with their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would have been the ſame to them that he was to him: he would have dealt as friendly, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with them, as he did with him: So as there ſhould not have needed to have been a Mediatour betwixt him and them, more then there was betwixt him and their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. That God was changed in this his carriage towards them, they might thank themſelves; the breach began on their parts. So is it here; Had not <hi>man</hi> firſt turned ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>God,</hi> broke covenant with him, God would never have turned enemy to man; there ſhould never have been any need of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt them, no more then there was betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and him in ſtate of innocency. Herein then let us juſtifie God; charging the ground of this enmity upon our ſelves. We are enemies to him, otherwiſe he had never been at enmity to us.</p>
                  <p>That we are ſo, we ſhall need no other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but what we carry about with us. Who is there but hath his conviction in his own boſome? even that principle of <hi>Enmity</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> which is to be found in the heart of man by nature. <hi>The carnall mind is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man in his unregenerate eſtate;) <hi>for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:124278:122"/> it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be: (viz.</hi> not without a work of ſupernaturall grace, ſubduing the rebellion of the will.) Thus are all men by nature ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God. No wonder then that <hi>they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe him</hi> (as it followeth in the next <hi>verſe, ver.</hi> 8.) that he ſhould be an enemy to them. Be we convinced of this <hi>Enmity,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this word <hi>[Mediatour]</hi> putteth us in mind.</p>

That he ſhould appoint an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> to negotiate with, and for man; a Mediatour to compremize and take up the difference betwixt him and them, and to reconcile man to himſelfe. Behold here an act of <hi>Grace, free</hi> grace, <hi>rich</hi> grace, <hi>meer</hi> grace. What was there in man that God ſhould thus regard his <hi>Enmity,</hi> or ſeek
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:124278:123"/> his <hi>Amity?</hi> Had God any need of man? nothing leſſe. He was abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happy and bleſſed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; He needed neither <hi>man,</hi> nor <hi>Angel:</hi> He was as happy before their Creation as after. It was all one to him, whether men, or no men; and thoſe, whether ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or friends: Their amity could add nothing to, nor their enmity detract any thing from his felicity: He ſhould have been no gainer by the one, and he could have been no loſer by the other. Hee knew which way to glorifie himſelfe, as well upon man an enemy, as upon man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:124278:124"/> that middle wall of partition,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 14. aboliſhing the Legall worſhip and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which being peculiar to the Jewes, divided them from the Gentiles,) but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> This he ſlew by taking away the ground and cauſe of it, <hi>viz. Sin.</hi> This it was (as I have ſhowen you) which firſt brought this <hi>Enmity</hi> into the world. And this it is that continueth it in the world. Now this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath taken away by his death: <hi>Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> Joh. 1.29 <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> world. Even of all that are given to him, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on him. Their ſin he hath taken away by way of <hi>Expiation:</hi> having made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto the Juſtice of God for it, ſo as it ſhall not be charged upon them unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; it ſhall not ſeparate betwixt God and them.</p>
                  <p>This he hath merited by his death; and this he hath declared and publiſhed. So the Apoſtle there goeth on <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. Having <hi>ſlain the Enmity by his Croſſe, he came and preached peace.</hi> This he did in his own perſon in the dayes of his fleſh, being then himſelf a <hi>Meſſenger of peace.</hi> And this (being himſelf gone off from the ſtage of the world) he cauſed to be done by others; ſending his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> upon the ſame errand, to <hi>preach peace;</hi> even that peace which is revealed in the Goſpel, peace betwixt God and Men; whoſe feet in that regard are ſaid to be beutifull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:124278:125"/>
                  <p>Loe here then <hi>glad tidings of good things</hi> (as it there followeth.) So is it to a convicted, a condemned Rebell to hear of ſome ſpeciall favorite, who hath undertaken to mediate for him with his Prince, to make his peace; much more that he hath done it. Such are the tidings which the Goſpel brings to all ſelfe-convicted, ſelfe-condemned ſinners, who being convinced of <hi>Enmity,</hi> deſire <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> with God. Loe here a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi> the great favorite of heaven, the <hi>onely begotten Sonne of God,</hi> he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to make their peace; nay hee hath done it. So as there wants no more to the compleating of this Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but onely that they ſhould come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and unto God by him, (of which I ſhall ſpeak more anon.) And therefore let not any in the ſenſe of this Enmity runne away from God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in the garden. If they be but willing to be Reconciled, lo here a way, a certaine way made for it: For this very end is <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a <hi>Mediatour betwixt God and men.</hi> This for thoſe who are yet in a ſtate of Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

A ſtrong conſolation. So is it to a pretended delinquent, to know that he hath a good <hi>Advocate,</hi> who knoweth how to anſwer the Law. Such an <hi>Advocate</hi> have all penitent beleeving ſinners; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Advocate, <hi>[Jeſus Chriſt the righteous;]</hi> one who by his own perfect obedience hath ſatisfied the Law alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:124278:126"/> which being by him pleaded, ſtops all further proceedings in way of Juſtice. Such an Advocate have we; One <hi>who is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for all our ſins</hi> (as it there followeth <hi>verſe</hi> 21.); One who by that Propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered up upon the altar of the Croſſe, expiated, ſatisfied for the ſinnes of his people. And having made that ſatisfaction upon earth, now he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it in heaven: Otherwiſe he ſhould loſe the fruit of his death. Having ſhed his blood upon earth, now he preſents it in heaven.</p>
                  <p>This did the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> under the Law (as I have ſhewen you) <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7.

And by this means doth he maintain that peace, which before he had made by the blood of his Croſs, viz. by <hi>Appearing</hi> in heaven as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> an <hi>Advocate</hi> on the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:124278:126"/> behalf of his people. A juſt ground not only of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> but of <hi>Triumph</hi> unto all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; ſo the Apoſtle maketh it in that place fore-cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. where he cloſeth up that his excellent Treatiſe of <hi>Juſtification</hi> with this triumphant Challenge, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? &amp;c. Who is he that condemneth?

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:124278:127"/> 10. <hi>If when we were enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi>] Of the two, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is a greater work then <hi>Confirmation.</hi> To be brought into grace and favour with God, then to be kept in it.

                  <p>Upon this condition it was that God the Father gave his <hi>Elect</hi> people unto Chriſt, that hee ſhould <hi>redeem</hi> them, and <hi>ſave</hi> them, <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that of all which he hath given mee I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day,</hi> John 6.39.

As for other Mediatours, we may cry unto them, and they not hear; as it was with that man in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> who came at midnight to his neighbours houſe to borrow bread for the entertaining of his unexpected gueſt, (it is <hi>Auguſtines</hi> obſervation,<note place="margin">Auguſt de temp.</note> and it is a witty one) he found the whole Family aſleep, <hi>Nullus de janitoribus reſpondet;</hi> None of the <hi>Porters,</hi> none of the <hi>Servants,</hi> none of the <hi>Children</hi> make him any anſwer; Onely the <hi>Maſter of

Thus men may knock long enough at the gates of heaven, before they receive any anſwer, whether from <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Saints,</hi> Gods <hi>Servants</hi> or <hi>Children.</hi> Onely the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> the Maſter of the family, he neither ſlumbers nor ſleepes; And therefore to him direct we our prayers, Ever making uſe of the Mediation of this our Mediator: Coming unto him, and to God by him.

                     <note place="margin">Such is true Mortification a voluntary act.</note> which is a voluntary and willing death.

                  <p n="2">2. It may be they have a <hi>clamorous conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

Upon this account it was that <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo willing to be rid of his <hi>thirty pieces of ſilver.</hi> No thanks to him; they were too hot for him to hold.

                  <p n="3">3. Happily they part with them not out of any diſlike they have of them; but for <hi>fear,</hi>

Upon this account do men ſometimes part with their ſins. Even as <hi>ſea-men</hi> in a ſtreſs, part with their goods, which they caſt over-board with their owne hands: Not that they are out of love with them, but becauſe they love their lives better. they ſee they muſt either part with them, or <hi>periſh</hi> with them. Or like a <hi>Cut-purſe,</hi> who being apprehended by a <hi>Sergeant,</hi> drops the

                     <hi>purſe</hi> which he hath cut or drawn: not that he is weary of it, but becauſe he knoweth if that ſhould be found about him, it would hang him. Even thus do many part with their ſins, when <hi>conſcience</hi> being awakened, they ſee hell gaping upon them. It may be, God's Serjeant <hi>[Death,]</hi> in their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, hath arreſted them, ready to carry them before the dreadfull Tribunall of a juſt and terrible God; And they know that if ſuch and ſuch ſins be found about them, there is no way but eternall condemnation for them. And hereupon they caſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it may be, ſeriouſly reſolving never more to own them, or to have any acquaintance with them.</p>
                  <p>Thus many ſeem to <hi>leave</hi> their ſins,<note place="margin">All far from true Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to part with them, who are yet far from <hi>mortifying</hi> of them. When men ſhall leave ſin, being <hi>enforced</hi> ſo to do, through the ſenſe of ſome preſent inconvenience, or through the clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe of an accuſing conſcience, or meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through fear of puniſhment temporall, or eternall; this is but a <hi>counterfeit Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> True Mortification muſt be a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary action;</hi> not <hi>Involuntary,</hi> nor yet <hi>Mixt.</hi> I call that a <hi>mixt action,</hi> which is partly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and partly involuntary.

                  <p>Not but that there may be ſome <hi>reluctancy</hi>

                  <p>And is our <hi>Mortification</hi> ſuch?

The <hi>materiall Temple</hi> did not fall down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, it was <hi>pulled down:</hi> And ſo was the <hi>myſticall Temple</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Body.

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:124278:206"/> herein is the truth of <hi>Mortification,</hi> when a man (as it were) layeth violent hands upon his ſins; cutteth them off being yet in their <hi>flower, ſtrength, vigour:</hi> not when they die for age.

Many have <hi>left</hi> their ſins, who have not <hi>mortified</hi> them: No, if their ſins be dead, they died a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death,</hi> they died alone. As for them, they were ſo far from offering <hi>violence</hi> to their luſts, from putting them to death, that they would willingly have ſaved their lives, if it had lyen in their power. And being dead, they follow them to their graves, as they do their <hi>dear friends,</hi> mourning and lamenting over them that they muſt part. Thus doth the <hi>aged Adulterer</hi> part with his inordinate luſt;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.19.</note> being now gray-headed, and his <hi>body dead,</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham's,</hi>) he leaveth the tricks of his youth, (as he counts and calls them.)

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:124278:206"/> (which yet is not ordinary,) ſometimes he becometh ſober, and abſtemious in his age. But what is the cauſe of it? why the reaſon inducing him to it is no other, then that which old <hi>Barzillai</hi> gave unto <hi>David,</hi> why he was not willing to follow the Court, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.34. He was now <hi>grown old,</hi> ſo as he could not <hi>diſcern betwixt good and evill,</hi> he had <hi>no taſte in that he eat, or in that he drunk.</hi> Upon the like ground the aged ſinner lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his <hi>intemperance;</hi> Time having ſnowed upon his head, and plowed upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, he cannot now find that ſweetneſſe, that delight in his ſin, which formerly he did.

And as a ſuffering in the fleſh, ſo a <hi>Crucifying of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>They that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:124278:211"/> are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh.]</hi> Now <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying</hi> (as I ſhewed you) is a painfull death. Elſewhere we finde it compared to a <hi>Plucking out the right eye,</hi> a <hi>Cutting off the right hand, Matth.</hi> 29.30. Such is the mortifying of the members of the <hi>Body of ſin,</hi> inordinate luſts, ſome of which may be as near and dear to a man, as his right eye, or hand: A painfull work.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not my purpoſe here largely to inſiſt upon the Doctrine of <hi>Mortification,</hi> which, as I have touched upon already, in handling of the <hi>verſes</hi> fore-going, ſo I ſhall meet with again and again in the <hi>verſes</hi> following. Briefly, To be <hi>dead unto ſin,</hi> is not to be wholly freed from the <hi>Inhabitation,</hi> and <hi>moleſtation</hi> of it; to be delivered from the <hi>body of ſin,</hi> to have it eradicated, plucked up by the roots. No, that is contrary to univerſall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: None but find and feel that <hi>fomes peccati, corruption of nature,</hi> the <hi>body of ſin,</hi> ſtill dwelling, and living, and working in them; But to be freed from the <hi>domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>reigning power</hi> of ſin. To have the vigour and ſtrength of ſin, (which is the <hi>life</hi> of ſin) ſo broken, ſo enervated and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the work of the Spirit of grace dwelling in the ſoul, as that it doth not rule, and reign, and bear ſway as it did before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. This it is to be dead to ſin. So much we may learn from this Apoſtle, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains his own meaning in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>verſe</hi> of this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:124278:219"/> 
                     <hi>Chapter:</hi> Having in the former <hi>verſe</hi> bid his <hi>Romans, Reckon themſelves dead unto ſin,</hi> he adds in this <hi>verſe, Let not therefore ſin reign in your mortall bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.]</hi> This <hi>reigning power</hi> of ſin, when it hath the upper hand of the motions of the Spirit of God in the ſoul, beareth ſuch a ſovereign, incontroulable ſway in it, ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring the faculties of it, as that the man is wholly overcome by it, made a ſervant, yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a willing and ſpontaneous obedience to it, making either none, or, at beſt, a weak and vain reſiſtance againſt it: this is the <hi>life</hi> of ſin. Now when this <hi>power</hi> is broken, when it is conquered by a ſuperiour power, the power of the Spirit of grace, ſo as the believer is freed from the dominion of ſin; now though ſin do ſtill live in him, yet he is ſaid to be dead to it.</p>
                  <p>And he may be ſaid ſo to be,<note place="margin">The regenerate perſon dead unto ſin, three wayes. 1. In regard of God's accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and that in a threefold reſpect. In regard of <hi>Acceptation, Inchoation, Aſſurance.</hi>

                     <hi>purſes,</hi> but by their <hi>hearts.</hi> And ſo is it in all other <hi>duties,</hi> and <hi>ſervices. Deſires</hi> and <hi>indeavours</hi> (where they are reall,) with God go for actuall <hi>performances.</hi> Now this is the Chriſtian's <hi>deſire:</hi> He deſireth nothing more then to be freed from the body of ſin, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> And this he ſeriouſly <hi>indeavours;</hi> he doth what in him lieth to kill and deſtroy it. Now this in God's gracious acceptation is <hi>death</hi> unto ſin.</p>
                  <p>As it is in the committing of ſin, <hi>Intentions</hi> in God's account go for <hi>actions: Wanton looks</hi> are <hi>Adultery: Whoſoever looketh on a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to luſt after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> Mat. 5.28. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering intentions</hi> are <hi>murder: Whoſoever hateth his brother is a murderer,</hi> 1 John 3.15.

Certainly,</hi> The wound which it hath received is incurable, a deadly wound, ſo as though it may live for a time, yet it ſhall languiſh and decay more and more till it be utterly extinct: which it ſhall be, and that <hi>ſpeedily;</hi> The death of ſin is not far off to ſuch a one. The ſtory in the Goſpel tels us of a certain <hi>Diſciple,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked leave of his <hi>Maſter Chriſt,</hi> that before ſuch time as he followed him, he might <hi>firſt go and bury his Father, Mat.</hi> 8.21.

                  <p>Though not preſently: I might add that as another Reſemblance, which I ſhall onely touch upon. Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, he was raiſed to the glory of God his Father, yet was he not preſently poſſeſſed of that <hi>Glory:</hi> He <hi>waited for a time,</hi> during his <hi>forty dayes</hi> betwixt his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion.</hi> In the mean time, he was not perfect, as he ſhould be. So much he willeth <hi>Mary</hi> to take notice of, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. where he ſaith to her, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended unto my Father;</hi>] intimating to her, that he would not have her to fix her thoughts ſo much upon his preſent condition, in as much as that was not the higheſt pitch of his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,</hi> which was to follow upon his <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion.</hi> Thus fareth it with the <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> though he be raiſed up to the glory of God his Father, made an <hi>Heir of glory,</hi> as all true believers are, <hi>If children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. Through the grace of God already vouchſafed to them, they are made in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> (as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12.) yet is he an <hi>heir under age,</hi> having a <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> but not <hi>in re,</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory through Chriſt, but not the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:124278:248"/> actuall <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of it. For this he muſt <hi>wait: We which have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.) <hi>even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, even the Redemption of our bodies.</hi>] Believers they have received the <hi>firſt fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> thoſe graces of the ſpirit which are to them a pledge and aſſurance of the full crop of perfect glorification in due ſeaſon: But this they muſt wait for untill the time appointed of the Father.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:124278:257"/> were opened, and many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, &amp; came out of the graves, &amp;c.</hi> v. 51.52 53.

No, his diſpenſations (as in other of his works, ſo) in this are various. But ordinarily ſo it is. Before dead ſoules ariſe and come out of the grave of ſin, there is a <hi>ſhaking,</hi> and an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and a rending <hi>of the Rocks.</hi> God prepares the hearts of his people for this bleſſed work by ſome degree of a <hi>Legall contrition</hi> and <hi>compunction;</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſoul to feel ſomewhat of the <hi>ſpirit of Bondage,</hi> letting into it ſome ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſin, and the wrath of God due unto ſin.</p>

Let a ſecond enquiry be, Have we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>the ſpirit of Chriſt?</hi> we know by what meanes it is that the <hi>dead body</hi> is raiſed, by putting a ſpirit into it. Thus we read of <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus his daughter,</hi> Luk. 8.55. After that Chriſt had called upon her, ſaying, <hi>Maid ariſe, her ſpirit came again</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and ſhee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſtraightway.</hi> By a like meanes doth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Chriſt effect this <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the ſoule by putting his ſpirit into it. By this meanes was his own <hi>Body</hi> raiſed, <hi>Hee was put to death in the fleſh, but quickned by the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>viz.</hi> that divine and eternall ſpirit which dwelt in his humane nature: And by the ſame meanes are <hi>dead ſoules</hi> quickned.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:124278:258"/> yee ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, and ſhall put my ſpirit in you, and yee ſhall live,</hi> ver. 13, 14.

By the ſame meanes doth Chriſt cauſe <hi>dead ſoules</hi> (being <hi>Captives unto ſin</hi>) to <hi>live,</hi> by putting his <hi>Spirit</hi> into them. Hence is it that he is called a <hi>Quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15.45. Becauſe by this meanes hee ſhal quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the dead <hi>Bodies</hi> of his Saints at the laſt day, <hi>Hee ſhall quicken your mortall Bodies by his ſpirit which dwelleth in you,</hi> Rom. 8.11. And by the ſame meanes hee now quickneth <hi>dead ſoules,</hi> by communicating his <hi>Spirit</hi> unto them: Which in this reſpect the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calleth, <hi>The Spirit of life,</hi> Rom. 8.2. Now then, have we received this <hi>Spirit?</hi> It was <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion to thoſe new <hi>Converts,</hi> Act. 19.2. <hi>Have ye received the Holy Ghoſt?]</hi> This he ſpake concerning the <hi>Extraordinary gifts</hi> of the Spirit which flouriſhed in the Church at that time.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:124278:259"/> thoſe who have any true union with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9.

Have you begun to put on this <hi>new man?</hi> put it on daily more and more, by indeavouring to <hi>grow in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts in the cloſe of his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle,) Adding one grace to another; to faith, vertue; to vertue, knowledge; to knowledge, temperance; to temperance, patience; to patience, godlineſſe, &amp;c:</hi> (as the ſame Apoſtle directs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6.)
